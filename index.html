      <title>Looking Back</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img alt="Looking Back" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/posts/375136/cover-photo/cover-1576714864.jpg?w=600&amp;q=50&amp;sharp=10&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>The snow has melted because of climate change and the reindeers are on strike - they were inspired by the Marriott employees. So Santa said he’ll come on a bike this year. We went bike shopping and I suggested he get the Pinarello Dogma F12 Disk SRAM, a $14,000 bike. It’s time he got himself a gift. However, before Santa starts creeping down chimneys and before I get tipsy from all the holiday spirit, I want to look back at 2019. To reflect on the highlights and music this year brought me. Here we go.]]>

      <title>Vancouver 🍁</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img alt="Vancouver 🍁" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/posts/366215/cover-photo/cover-1571124661.jpg?w=600&amp;q=50&amp;sharp=10&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>It’s been ten months since my last solo trip. A lot has changed since then, and I&#39;ve had to ruthlessly reevaluate my life. Even the way I travel. Unlike Barcelona, Vancouver has been slow and relaxed. Instead of running to visit landmarks, I spent time hiking, taking photo walks, writing postcards, drawing, and listening to The Black Keys. It’s been nice taking a break from cycling too, although I do miss my bike.]]>

        <![CDATA[<img alt="Machu Picchu ⛰" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/posts/346506/cover-photo/cover-1558296805.jpeg?w=600&amp;q=50&amp;sharp=10&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>Two years ago my friends and I talked about this trip, but it took us an extra year to substantiate our plans and actually make it to Machu Picchu. Getting to the top was long and tedious, and marked this as the most cumbersome trip I&#39;ve ever done.Here is a breakdown of our commute to the top of Wayna Picchu:✈️ San Francisco to Lima: 9 hrs | 453 ft gain.✈️ Lima to Cusco: 1 hr | 10,647 ft gain.🚂 Cusco to Aguascalientes: 3.5 hrs | 6,194 ft drop.🚌 Aguascalientes to Machu Picchu entrance: 35 mins | 1,776 ft gain.🥾 Machu Picchu entrance to Wayna Picchu peak: 1.5 hrs | 863 ft gain.Here are photos from our time in Cusco.]]>

      <title>Cusco 🦙</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img alt="Cusco 🦙" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/gallery_343219/photos/ph_14rd340ydp85q993/photo.jpeg?w=600&amp;q=60&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>11,152 ft. The highest I have ever been. A bowl full of coca leaves awaited us at the airport, which we ate with intrigue. Our taxi driver was the first to inform us that the city is shaped like a sitting Puma - to symbolize the power of the earth. At the head of the Puma is the temple of Saqsaywaman, and the body is surrounded by two rivers. Back in the days, the high ranking folks lived inside the Puma while the rest lived outside.Cusco reminded me of Nepal in a déjà vu kind of way. Stray dogs, pixelated billboards, underpowered motorcycles, and similar brown faces. It is almost like God picked up a city from Nepal, dusted it a little bit, and gently put it down in Peru. I felt like I had come home...until I woke up in the middle of the night gasping for oxygen. That was not fun.]]>

      <title>Prague 🇨🇿</title>

        <![CDATA[<img alt="Prague 🇨🇿" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/posts/331414/cover-photo/cover-1551760943.jpg?w=600&amp;q=50&amp;sharp=10&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>The regal designs and immaculate details of the Municipal House in Prague was my favorite photography spot. The rooms boast an uncompromising level of attention paid to even the most mundane objects. The golden hue of the interiors create the perfect lighting. I highly recommend getting a tour when you&#39;re there.]]>

      <title>Barcelona</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img alt="Barcelona" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/posts/321825/cover-photo/cover-1545412766.jpg?w=600&amp;q=50&amp;sharp=10&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>When I was in Italy, I stumbled upon unbelievably cheap flights to Barcelona. It was $310 for a non-stop round trip from San Francisco. To put this in perspective, I&#39;ve paid double to fly to D.C. So I pinched myself to make sure I wasn&#39;t dreaming and booked my trip.The flight was through Iberia, a low cost airline that is now the cheapest way to get to Europe. There was in-flight entertainment for every seat but no food or drinks, and I was completely fine with that given the chump change I paid. I highly recommend them for your next budget travel!]]>

      <title>Montserrat 🚡</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img alt="Montserrat 🚡" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/gallery_321021/photos/ph_gz9pp87czu9qit99/photo.jpg?w=600&amp;q=60&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>On my second day in Barcelona, I went on a tour to Montserrat. Literally meaning &quot;serrated mountains&quot;, it is a multi-peaked mountain range northwest of Barcelona. We visited the Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey, which is famous for enshrining the Virgin of Montserrat and houses the beautiful black madonna. On our way down, we took the Aeri de Montserrat, which is the local cable car service to and from the town where the abbey is located. My friend told me Montserrat had Wes Anderson vibes. I wouldn&#39;t have thought of that myself, but when I look back I see the resemblance. The hue of the place reminds of the Grand Budapest Hotel - pink, yellow, and foggy. Afterwards we met up with Juan, a humble Spanish cowboy. He introduced us to his charming horses and taught us the basics of horseback riding. We explored the nearby countryside on horseback which was one of the highlights of my trip. One day I&#39;ll make it to Tiger&#39;s Nest and draw parallels between the two, but for now I feel blessed.]]>

      <title>Cadaqués 🛵</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img alt="Cadaqués 🛵" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/gallery_320191/photos/ph_jd689oflmznq9yd7/photo.jpg?w=600&amp;q=60&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>Cadaqués is a coastal town in the northeast corner of Spain, close to France. Two hours from Barcelona, it rests peacefully in the Costa Brava region of Catalonia. It was a haven for the Catalonian surrealist, Salvador Dali, who grew up fishing with his father in the nearby sea. Cadaqués felt empty, but in a nice way. There were tourists but not obnoxiously many. The colorful doors, cute facades, and bleached walls made me think I was inside a postcard. It seemed like the locals decorated the town and went away. Empty wine bottles left candidly on the streets, Vespas parked precisely, and clothes hung neatly. The stone-paved alleys, the cool breeze from the sea, the occasional sound of church bells. Everything in Cadaqués made me want to come back. Not to visit or take photos, but to live here some day. To retire in the coast that inspired the world&#39;s most eccentric artist. ]]>

      <title>Rome 🐺</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<img alt="Rome 🐺" src="https://exposure.imgix.net/production/posts/310875/cover-photo/cover-1539283459.JPG?w=600&amp;q=50&amp;sharp=10&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;auto=format" /><br>Rome. 2800 years old. The history is visible in every corner of the city. Even immaculately preserved.The Sampietrini made me realize how advanced the city&#39;s infrastructure was during the heights of the Roman empire. Laid out to accelerate military movements in the 15th century, the stone paved roads still persistently sprawl throughout the city.Trastevere and Monti are Rome&#39;s essential neighborhoods for local dinning and elegant bars. Dinner at Il Duca in Trastevere is a must. I recommend Filetto di Baccala, followed by Risotto con Gamberi and Coda alla Vaccinara, and finished with your favorite Dolce in coppa. Skip expensive wines, and get the vino rosso de casa. Local, cheap, and pairs well with your courses. In Monti, get drinks at the Sacripant Art Gallery. Order in Italian.Rome was our last stop. This gave me a sense of awe that people (during the glory days of the Empire) felt as they arrived at Rome after traveling hundreds of miles to the center of civilization.]]>
